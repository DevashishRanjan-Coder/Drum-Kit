# Drum Kit

This project is a virtual drum kit.
This made me practice and understand how to handle events using addEventListener() in HTML, how to manipulate HTML elements/CSS animations using DOM and how to use the HTML Audio() element.

The logic is written in javascript, structure is done using HTML and styling is done using CSS.
